# test project
This is a project used to evaluate my coding skills and Android knowledge.

## Description
The project's idea is to list trending projects from Github and then tap on one of them and show their details.


- Write your application in Kotlin
- Ensure your application looks good on different screen sizes and densities
- Ensure your application supports Android API 23+
- Use good architecture and design patterns
- Use valuable external libraries that you are used to
- Use reactive programming

- Filtering and ordering functionalities
- Unit tests
- Shared element transition or other animations (but only if they are functional to the user experience)
